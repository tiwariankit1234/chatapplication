This is a Microsoft Teams-inspired chat application built using React JS and Chat Engine. The application is designed to provide a clean, intuitive user interface and robust messaging features, closely mimicking Microsoft Teams in terms of functionality.

I developed this project from scratch, building it to demonstrate my skills with React JS, real-time messaging, and the Chat Engine API. The application includes several key features like real-time chat, user authentication, and a responsive design.

Features
Real-time messaging and notifications
User authentication and account management
Customizable chat interface with channels and private chats
Responsive and mobile-friendly design
Technologies Used
React JS: For building the front-end UI components.
Chat Engine: For real-time messaging functionality.
CSS/SCSS: For styling the application with a modern design.

Challenges Faced
Real-Time Messaging: Integrating real-time messaging with Chat Engine was an exciting challenge. I had to learn how to handle WebSocket connections efficiently to provide seamless, instant communication.

User Authentication: Ensuring secure user login and managing user sessions for multiple users in different chat rooms was another technical hurdle that was overcome using Chat Engine's authentication system.

UI/UX Design: I focused on building a user-friendly and responsive interface, inspired by Microsoft Teams but tailored to meet the project’s needs.

Conclusion
This project showcases my ability to build a production-ready chat application using React JS and external APIs like Chat Engine. It not only helped me solidify my understanding of React but also allowed me to learn how to integrate APIs to create fully functional web applications.
